#summary HMMLA an implementation of Hidden Markov Models with Latent Annotations

= Introduction =

HMM-LAs [http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N09/N09-2054.pdf (Huang et al., 2009)] are HMMs that induce latent sub-tags to increase tagging accuracy. 

This implementation can be either used as a standard HMM tagger or to refine the annotations of an existing treebank.

= Training =

Assuming a training file esp.train with the following form:

<pre>
1	El	el	d	
2	aumento	aumento	n	
3	del	del	s	
4	índice	índice	n	
</pre>
(Note, that the lemmata are not necessary.) A refining model can be trained by calling:

<pre>
java -ea -cp hmmla.jar hmmla.Trainer -train-file form-index=1,tag-index=3,esp.train\
                                     -model-name esp.hmmla\
                                     -num-tags 50\
                                     -refine true
</pre>

Where form-index=1 specifies that the word form can bound in the second column.

= Tagging =

Assuming a test file esp.test of the same format as esp.train we can annotate the file with:

<pre>
java -ea -cp hmmla.jar hmmla.Tagger  -model-name esp.hmmla\
                                     -test-file form-index=1,tag-index=3,conll2007/esp.test\
                                     -pred-file esp.test.pred
</pre>

The output esp.test.pred will have the following form:

<pre>
0	Las	d1
1	reservas	n10
2	de	s010
3	oro	n11
</pre>
