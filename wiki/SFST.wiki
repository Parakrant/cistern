SFST Finite State Tools

= Introduction =

SFST is a toolkit for the implementation of morphological analysers and other tools which are based on finite state transducer technology. 

= Details =

=== The SFST tools comprise ===
  * a programming language for finite state transducers (FST)
  * a compiler which translates the FST programs into minimised transducers
  * interactive and batch-mode programs for analysis and generation
  * tools for comparing and printing transducers
  * an efficient C++ transducer library for the implementation of new FST tools

=== SFST is ===
  * freely available under the GNU Public License
  * easy to learn for users who are familiar with grep, sed, or Perl.
  * efficient implementation in C++
  * supports
     * a wide range of transducer operations
     * UTF-8 character coding
     * weighted transducers (basic functionality only)
