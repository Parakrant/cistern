#summary A word clustering tool.

= Introduction =

MarLiN is program suite to induce word clusters form text.
It is based on the algorithm by Martin et al. (1998).

= Usage =

The following code will cluster the words in _example.txt_ into 10 classes.

<pre>
marlin_count --text example.txt --bigrams bigrams --words words 
marlin_cluster --words words --bigrams bigrams --output --c 10
</pre>

_marlin_count_ extracts a word list and bigram statistics and _marlin_cluster_ performs the actual clustering.

= Pretrained Clusterings =

Pretrained clustering for English, German, Hungarian, Latin and Spanish can be found [http://cistern.cis.lmu.de/marmot/naacl2015/ here].
